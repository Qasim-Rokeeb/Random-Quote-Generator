# Day 7 - Quote of the Day 🧠

This is Day 7 of my 30-Day React Relearning Journey. The focus of this project is:

- Consuming external APIs with CORS considerations
- Displaying dynamic quotes using `useEffect` and `fetch`
- Handling asynchronous logic and state updates
- Adding a Tweet button to share quotes on Twitter

---

## 🚀 What I Learned

✅ How to safely fetch data from third-party APIs using proxies  
✅ Preventing cached responses with `disableCache=true`  
✅ Parsing JSON wrapped in stringified API payloads  
✅ Managing loading and error states  
✅ Using `window.open()` for sharing to Twitter

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- React (JavaScript)
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- ZenQuotes API via AllOrigins
